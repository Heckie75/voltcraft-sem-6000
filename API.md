# Characteristics

In order to control the device you need to determine the correct handles by quering the characteristics, e.g.

```
$ gatttool -b FC:69:47:06:CB:C6 -I

| uuid | handle | description                                      |
|------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 2a00 | 0x0003 | Device name                                      |
| fff1 | 0x0025 | Device vendor, hardware, firmware                |
| fff3 | 0x002b | Handle for command requests ```char-write-cmd``` |
| fff4 | 0x002e | Handle for receiving notifications               |

Note: The handles can be different. They relate on firmware and hardware version of your device

```

# Hardware version and MTU
If you have a device with hardware version 2 or lower you will get multiple notifications per request which depends on the type of request.
If you have a device with hardware version 3 or above you MUST set the so called MTU so that the package size of notifications is set to 160 bytes. Then you get always just one notification per request.

Note: Typical 0xffff end sequence is missing in this response. This is probably since there is no room for it.

Starting with hardware version 3 the reported length is shorter, i.e. ```0x0f``` instead of ```0xff```.

A notification looks like this:
```
